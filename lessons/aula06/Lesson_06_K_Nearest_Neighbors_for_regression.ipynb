Data is the record of everything that's going on and what we should learn from it. The real value of all this information is what it means.\n",

For example, the **maximum_nights** column has values as low as 30 and high as 1125, in the first few rows itself.

While this is helpful deliberate practice to understand how the mechanics work, you can be more productive and iterate quicker by using a library that handles most of the implementation. In this subsection, we'll learn about the [scikit-learn library](http://scikit-learn.org/), which is the most popular machine learning in Python. Scikit-learn contains functions for all of the major machine learning algorithms and a simple, unified workflow. Both of these properties allow data scientists to be incredibly productive when training and testing different models on a new dataset.\n",

K-fold cross validation, on the other hand, takes advantage of a larger proportion of the data during training while still rotating through different subsets of the data to avoid the issues of train/test validation.\n",

To build a better k-nearest neighbors model, we can change the features it uses or tweak the number of neighbors (a hyperparameter). To accurately understand a model's performance, we can perform k-fold cross validation and select the proper number of folds. We've learned how scikit-learn makes it easy for us to quickly experiment with these different knobs when it comes to building a better model.
